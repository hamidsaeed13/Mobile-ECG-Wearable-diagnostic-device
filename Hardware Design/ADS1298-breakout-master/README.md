ADS1298-breakout
================

This is an ADS1298 breakout board. It can also be used with the ADS1294 and ADS1296. 

If you are looking for a full Arduino shield with analog input capability, you might
be interested in the [HackEEG Shield](https://github.com/adamfeuer/hackeeg-shield) 
instead. The HackEEG shield is compatible with the ADS1298 or ADS1299.

The ADS1298 is an 8 channel ADC chip with SPI interface, meant for ECG and EEG:

The breakout board needs +5v input, and provides clean analog and digital power, along with some minimal support circuitry.

Most of the ADS1298's pins are available on the two 20-pin headers.
 
This board is meant for basic system debugging - electrode circuitry for EEG or ECG is not provided, just access to
the chip's differential input pins.

v0.1 of the board has been made and is in testing; v0.2 of the board has not been made yet, and is development.

Connecting the Board to an Arduino Due
======================================

There is an Arduino Due pinout diagram in docs/arduino_pinout_diagram.png. Refer to that when making the wiring
connections. There are also a couple of photos.

Testing
=======

The Arduino Due driver software for this board can be found in the
[ADS129x-tools](https://github.com/adamfeuer/ADS129x-tools) github repository.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!
