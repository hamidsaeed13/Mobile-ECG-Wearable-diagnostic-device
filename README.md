## Motivation:
- Existing ECG solutions are large and costly.
- Patients must be hospitalized, making it difficult to maintain long-term ECG logs.
- 24/7 ECG monitoring in remote areas is a challenge.

## Our Solution:
- 10-lead, 12-channel ECG diagnostic device.
- Bluetooth-enabled data transmission to smartphones for processing and log maintenance.
